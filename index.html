          <p id="spacing">Ever since my first xbox I have loved video games. In 2018-2019 I built my own first gaming computer. I have been constantly upgrading it to keep up with graphical and processing demands. Recently I decided since I liked video games so much, I might enjoy trying to make my own. I downloaded Unity and began going through the tutorials. When I got stuck, my dad who works in that field was able to help me. I found that I love designing my own games and am looking foward to later this year when we will begin working with Unity as a class.</p>

          <h2 id="spacing">Upcoming Project</h2>
          <p id="spacing">In the second semester this year our class will be working with the game engine Unity to develop basic games both individually and in groups.</p>
